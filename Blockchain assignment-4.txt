Q.1  What does turing completeness mean
Ans  Turing completeness is provided by Ethereum blockchain.It means it can do anything that a human can think on can convert it to code.Any kind of code can be run
     on ETH so it can be said that ETH blockchain is turing complete.


Q.2  Which drawbacks of bitcoin blockchain does ethereum blockchain overcome
Ans  In Bitcoin blockchain Loops are not available so if you what to repeat any command you have write that code again and again. This problem is solved by Ethereum
     blockchain as it supports loop command like for , while , repeat and so on. So the length of code can be minimized and code can be written in less number of lines.
 

Q.3  What are Externally Owned Accounts(EOA) in the Ethereum blockchain
Ans  So basically there are 2 types of account in ETH blockchain .They are Externally Owned Account and Contract Account. Externally owned account have a private key 
which is used to control over access to funds and contracts. EOA are used for transactions. The basic use of this is an EOA sending a request transaction to send ETH on to another address 


Q.4  What are Contract Accounts(CA) in the Ethereum blockchain
Ans  Basically a contract account is a code that is activated only when the request is send through externally owned account. Contract account represents the Smart contract
     on ETH blockchain. Smart contract interect with Blockchain using EOA when transactions happens.



Q.5  Why do we need to pay gas fees in the Ethereum blockchain
Ans  Gas fees can also be reffered as priority fees. If you want your transaction to validate faster you pay more gas fees.But some amount should always be paid when
     transaction is made to miner to validate the transaction .It is because the miner has used his computational power to validate your transaction.Gas fees are 
     updated every 15 seconds.( 1 gwei = 10*-9 ETH ) .
